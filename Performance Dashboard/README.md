# Performance Dashboard

The Performance Dashboard is a Power BI project that utilizes the Power BI Testing Data dataset to create an interactive dashboard that displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for an organization. The dataset includes information about sales, revenue, and customer satisfaction ratings.

The dashboard provides a high-level view of the organization's performance by presenting data in visually appealing and easy-to-understand charts and graphs.
The Performance Dashboard is highly interactive and allows users to drill down into the data to gain deeper insights into the organization's performance. It also allows users to filter the data by various dimensions such as date, product category, and region, making it easy to analyze the data from different perspectives. Overall, the Performance Dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring and improving an organization's performance.
